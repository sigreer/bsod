# BSOD

## Blue Screen of Directus

A replica of the now (if it wasn't already) infamous BSOD of Microsoft Windows courtesy of CrowdStrike. Additional trolling from the Linux penguin included for mild amusement.

## What is it?

Astro powered by Directus as a backend with added Penguin. Github Actions generates the static content and deploys to Github Pages each time a commit is pushed to the repo.

Astro's flexibility means it's easy to integrate with frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte, providing endless resources for almost infinite trolling. I'll maybe build it out into a full website if I can find some inspiration from the next global IT meltdown. Fingers crossed it's nothing to do with Linux! :-)
